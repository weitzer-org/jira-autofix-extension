<INSTRUCTIONS>
The user wants to set the default GitHub repository for the jira-autofix extension.

1. Parse the input argument to extract the GitHub repository URL.
   - Accept formats like:
     - `https://github.com/owner/repo`
     - `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`
     - `owner/repo`
     - `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`
   - Normalize to the format: `owner/repo` (e.g., `benw307/logo-maker-weitzer`)

2. Save the repository to a config file:
   - Create/overwrite the file: `~/.jira-autofix-repo`
   - Write just the `owner/repo` string to this file.

3. Confirm to the user:
   - Print: "✅ Default repository set to: <owner>/<repo>"
   - Print: "The jira-autofix command will now use this repository by default."
   - Print: "To change it, run: /setrepo <new-repo-url>"
   - Print: "To clear it, run: /clearrepo"

If no argument is provided:
   - Check if `~/.jira-autofix-repo` exists and print its current value.
   - If not set, print: "No default repository is set. Usage: /setrepo <github-repo-url>"
